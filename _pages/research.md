# Research
**Our research focuses on the following aspects:**

**我们主要关注以下研究方向：**

- **钯催化的动态胺排序** 
在原子或分子水平操控合成子，并高效、高选择性地将其组装成功能分子，是合成化学的终极追求之一。其中，对具有微小差异的分子同系物进行精确识别和有序组装，能够最大程度地减少对保护基团的依赖，最大限度地简化目标分子的合成路线，从而显著提高反应的原子和步骤经济性。在合成化学中，高化学和立体选择性地组装不同的胺同系物，以合成具有独特药理化学性质的非对称手性二胺，更是十分有意义且具有挑战性的。在动态组合化学（DCC）中，利用酶作为生物受体，在特殊的生物和化学体系中已经实现了脂肪胺在亚胺形式下的高选择性识别。受此启发，研究团队通过不同N,O-缩醛对零价钯氧化加成所形成的环钯络合物的反应活性差异，来实现对脂肪胺的高效区分。具体而言，富电子的脂肪胺由于更好的配位能力，优先和钯催化剂生成稳定的三元环钯络合物并发生胺甲基化反应，而缺电子的胺则倾向于游离在体系中发生后续的胺化反应。基于此，研究团队成功开发了一种钯催化的动态胺排序策略，从两种或多种不同的胺，共轭二烯和多聚甲醛出发，以优秀的化学、区域和对映选择性构建了一系列非对称手性 1,3-二胺。

- **金属电子梭催化** 
利用过渡金属催化剂作为电子梭转移电子而不参与成键，避免不稳定烷基-金属物种的生成，实现新型C(sp3)-C(sp3)成键反应。
传统过渡金属催化的碳-碳成键反应历经氧化加成-转金属化-还原消除的基元步骤。该基元反应过程在应用于烷基偶联试剂时，会生成不稳定烷基金属中间体，难以发生还原消除得到偶联产物。课题组创新性地提出金属电子梭催化范式，为C(sp3)-C(sp3)成键反应开辟了新的催化模式。在该过程中，金属催化剂仅作为电子梭来引发和淬灭自由基而不生成烷基金属中间体，借助自由基加成过程实现多个烷基碳碳键的构建。利用该策略，课题组实现了一系列C(sp3)-C(sp3)成键反应，包括普适性的非活化烯烃双烷基化反应，克服了此前烯烃双烷基化反应对烯烃和偶联试剂底物适用范围的限制。

- **Personalization, Recommender System, Online Advertising, Search Engine, and Information Retrieval.** The Recommender Systems, Online Advertising, and Search Engines are three interrelated components in Information Retrieval that help users find the information and content they need among a vast amount of data. Recommender Systems provide personalized recommendations based on user behavior, preferences, and historical interactions. Online Advertising leverages user data to deliver relevant advertisements to individuals. Search Engines, such as Google and Baidu, use algorithms to index and rank webpages based on relevance and quality, helping users find the information they are looking for. Together, these three components work to improve the overall search experience for users and make it more efficient. The integration of machine learning techniques, deep learning, and big data analytics into these systems has made it possible to deliver highly accurate recommendations and advertisements in real-time, while providing a more engaging search experience. The use of these technologies has been shown to increase user satisfaction and revenue for businesses, making them critical components of modern information systems.

- **Urban Computing, Smart City, GeoAI, Spatio-Temporal Data Analysis, and Location-Based Social Networks.** Urban Computing is a field that uses technology and data to enhance the quality of life and improve the efficiency of urban environments. In the context of Smart Cities, Urban Computing involves the use of sensors, data analytics, and artificial intelligence to gather and analyze data on various aspects of urban life, such as traffic, energy consumption, air quality, and more. The goal of Urban Computing in Smart Cities is to create more sustainable, livable, and efficient cities by using technology to optimize various urban systems and services. This involves using data to make informed decisions about city planning, transportation, energy management, and other critical urban infrastructure. By leveraging the latest advances in technology, Urban Computing in Smart Cities has the potential to make cities more responsive, resilient, and sustainable, while improving the quality of life for their residents.

- **Theoretical Machine Learning: Large Language Model, Reinforcement Learning, AutoML, AGI, Graph Learning, Trustworthy AI, and Multimodal ML.** Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and improve from experience. Our Lab focuses on several subfields within Machine Learning. One of the important advancements is large language models, which use natural language processing techniques to generate human-like responses and can be applied in various areas such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and text summarization. Deep Reinforcement Learning involves training algorithms to make decisions and take actions in complex, dynamic environments. AutoML refers to the automation of the machine learning process, including model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model training. AGI or Artificial General Intelligence, refers to the creation of machines that can perform tasks and solve problems like a human being. Graph Learning is a type of machine learning that deals with graph-structured data, such as social networks, transportation networks, and biological networks. Trustworthy AI refers to the development of machine learning models that are reliable, transparent, and ethical in their decision-making processes. Multimodal ML involves the integration of multiple forms of data, such as text, image, audio, and video, to create more sophisticated and accurate models. These subfields of Machine Learning are shaping the future of Artificial Intelligence, helping to advance the field and solving complex problems in a variety of industries and domains.

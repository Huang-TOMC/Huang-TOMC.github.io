  abstract = {Transformer-based models have gained significant traction in sequential recommender systems (SRSs) for their ability to capture user-item interactions effectively. However, these models often suffer from high computational costs and slow inference. Meanwhile, existing efficient SRS approaches struggle to embed high-quality semantic and positional information into latent representations. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces GLINT-RU, a lightweight and efficient SRS leveraging a single-layer dense selective Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) module to accelerate inference. By incorporating a dense selective gate, GLINT-RU adaptively captures temporal dependencies and fine-grained positional information, generating high-quality latent representations. Additionally, a parallel mixing block infuses fine-grained positional features into user-item interactions, enhancing both recommendation quality and efficiency. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that GLINT-RU achieves superior prediction accuracy and inference speed, outperforming baselines based on RNNs, Transformers, MLPs, and SSMs. These results establish GLINT-RU as a powerful and efficient solution for SRSs. The implementation code is publicly available for reproducibility. https://github.com/szhang-cityu/GLINT-RU.},
